# Cross-Sell-Prediction
A Machine Learning model to predict the cross-selling of vehicle insurance to customers who have bought health insurance using customer data.

A company's health insurance customer data is processed and analyzed to apply different machine learning algorithms like Naive-Bayes, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression to predict whether the customers who purchased health insurance would buy vehicle insurance as well. This is done to help in the targeted marketing process of an insurance firm. The process is carried out using Python and scikit-learn is used for the application of ML algorithms.
